# IsolateAlpha-PCA
PCA is used widely in data science. Itâ€™s a way to reduce the number of dimensions in a data set. In a stock portfolio, a dimension might be a column of returns for one of the stocks. In a portfolio of 100 stocks, there are 100 dimensions. PCA converts those 100 dimensions into the few that explain the most variance in the data.
